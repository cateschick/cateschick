- A Little Bit About Me

    Hi! My name is Cate Schick and I am currently a rising senior at Duke University.

    I'm pursuing an interdisciplinary major in Neuroscience and Computer Science that
    I created myself titled "Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning". Basically, it's a combination
    of these two subjects with a primary focus on learning (both biological and
    artifical) and the ways in which both brains and machines reason with information 
    and make a decision.

- Career Goals

    I'm interested in going into tech after I graduate in 2022, and I'm still exploring 
    careers within this sector to decide which areas I like best. As of right now, I am 
    looking into becoming a Software Developer

- What can you find on my GitHub?

  I currently have uploaded some projects and files from my classes at Duke as well as 
  some practice coding problems from sites such as Leetcode and Hackerrank. In the future, 
  I hope to upload some personal projects I am planning, including a data visualization app.
