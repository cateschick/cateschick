<h1> Welcome To My GitHub!!! </h1>
<h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>

   <p>Hi! My name is Cate Schick and I am currently a senior at Duke University.</p>

   <p>I'm pursuing an interdisciplinary major in Neuroscience and Computer Science that
    I created myself titled "Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning". Basically, my major is a combination
    of these two subjects with a primary focus on learning (both biological and
    artifical) and the ways in which both brains and machines reason with information 
    in order to make a decision.</p>

<h2>Career Goals</h2>

   <p>I'm interested in going into tech after I graduate in May 2022, specifically as a Software Engineer. I like building things, solving problems, and explaining complex concepts in terms anyone can understand.</p>
    
   <p> During the Summer of 2021, I worked as a backend software engineer in the Lower East Side, and I enjoyed 
   everything about it. I am continuing to work for this company part-time during my senior year. I'm also interested in artificial intelligence, specifically machine learning. </p>

<h2>What Can You Find On My GitHub?</h2>

  <p>I currently have uploaded some projects and files from my classes at Duke as well as 
  some personal projects to further my understanding of certain technologies.</p>
  
<h2>What Do I Do Besides Code?</h2>

   <p>In my free time, I love reading Stephen King books, baking artsy cupcakes, boxing, and bartending.</p>
