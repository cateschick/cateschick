<h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>

    Hi! My name is Cate Schick and I am currently a rising senior at Duke University.

    I'm pursuing an interdisciplinary major in Neuroscience and Computer Science that
    I created myself titled "Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning". Basically, it's a combination
    of these two subjects with a primary focus on learning (both biological and
    artifical) and the ways in which both brains and machines reason with information 
    and make a decision.

<h2>Career Goals</h2>

    I'm interested in going into tech after I graduate in 2022, and I'm still exploring 
    careers within this sector to decide which areas I like best!

<h2>What Can You Find On My GitHub?</h2>

  I currently have uploaded some projects and files from my classes at Duke as well as 
  some personal projects to further my understanding of certain technologies.
  
<h2>What Do I Do Besides Code?</h2>

    In my free time, I love reading Stephen King books, boxing, soccer, and bartending.
